OpenMW
======

OpenMW is an open-source open-world RPG game engine that supports playing Morrowind by Bethesda Softworks. You need to own the game for OpenMW to play Morrowind.

#### Relevant to this branch only:
This is a one-off version of OpenMW intended to provide a better experience for controller players.

None of this is my work. I took the existing work of https://gitlab.com/grablair/openmw/-/commits/gui-gamepad-controls-1/ and the current master branch of https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw as of 10/28/23 and merged them. (grablair's branch had not been merged with OpenMW's master branch in almost 2 years, and I wanted the last 2 years of OpenMw's updates plus better controller support.) I am not planning on keeping this up to date with OpenMW's master branch, but you're welcome to fork this and do so yourself. Shouldn't be too difficult to keep up to date, at least until they make major changes to the UI, which they probably won't anytime soon, but you never know.

I'm not super familiar with the history of the controller support issue (see https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/3740 for more information) but my brief, very incomplete understanding is that it has been worked on here and there by independent developers who wanted a better controller experience for themselves, but it isn't being worked on by any of the regular contributors to OpenMW, and probably never will be, since they and most of their audience are primarily keyboard and mouse players.

The added controller support is also incomplete and does not work for all user interfaces and may have bugs. (I'm not planning on extending the controller support myself, I don't have the skills or background with the project to do so.) But, it works for a lot of things and it's better than nothing. This may serve as a jumping-off point for other developers who want to work on a more updated version (at least relative to the main project) of improved controller support for OpenMW.

OpenMW also comes with OpenMW-CS, a replacement for Bethesda's Construction Set.

Current Status
--------------

The main quests in Morrowind, Tribunal and Bloodmoon are all completable. Some issues with side quests are to be expected (but rare). Check the [bug tracker](https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/issues?label_name%5B%5D=1.0) for a list of issues we need to resolve before the "1.0" release. Even before the "1.0" release however, OpenMW boasts some new [features](https://wiki.openmw.org/index.php?title=Features), such as improved graphics and user interfaces.

Pre-existing modifications created for the original Morrowind engine can be hit-and-miss. The OpenMW script compiler performs more thorough error-checking than Morrowind does, meaning that a mod created for Morrowind may not necessarily run in OpenMW. Some mods also rely on quirky behaviour or engine bugs in order to work. We are considering such compatibility issues on a case-by-case basis - in some cases adding a workaround to OpenMW may be feasible, in other cases fixing the mod will be the only option. If you know of any mods that work or don't work, feel free to add them to the [Mod status](https://wiki.openmw.org/index.php?title=Mod_status) wiki page.

The data path
-------------

The data path tells OpenMW where to find your Morrowind files. If you run the launcher, OpenMW should be able to pick up the location of these files on its own, if both Morrowind and OpenMW are installed properly (installing Morrowind under WINE is considered a proper install).
