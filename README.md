# openmw-better-controller

This is a one-off version of OpenMW intended to provide a better experience for controller players.

None of this is my work. I took the existing work of https://gitlab.com/grablair/openmw/-/commits/gui-gamepad-controls-1/ and the current master branch of https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw as of 10/28/23 and merged them. (grablair's branch had not been merged with OpenMW's master branch in almost 2 years, and I wanted the last 2 years of OpenMw's updates plus better controller support.) I am not planning on keeping this up to date with OpenMW's master branch, but you're welcome to fork this and do so yourself. Shouldn't be too difficult to keep up to date, at least until they make major changes to the UI, which they probably won't anytime soon, but you never know.

I'm not super familiar with the history of the controller support issue (see https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/3740 for more information) but my brief, very incomplete understanding is that it has been worked on here and there by independent developers who wanted a better controller experience for themselves, but it isn't being worked on by any of the regular contributors to OpenMW, and probably never will be, since they and most of their audience are primarily keyboard and mouse players.

The added controller support is also incomplete and does not work for all user interfaces and may have bugs. (I'm not planning on extending the controller support myself, I don't have the skills or background with the project to do so.) But, it works for a lot of things and it's better than nothing. This may serve as a jumping-off point for other developers who want to work on a more updated version (at least relative to the main project) of improved controller support for OpenMW.
